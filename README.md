üõí Amazon E-Commerce Sales Performance Dashboard
A dynamic, interactive data visualization project designed to analyze and monitor e-commerce sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability using Amazon sales data.

üéØ Short Description / Purpose
This Power BI dashboard provides a detailed operational and strategic view of an Amazon sales channel, enabling users to track key metrics like revenue, profit margin, and order volume over time. Its purpose is to turn large sales transaction data into clear, actionable insights for inventory management, marketing campaign evaluation, and overall business optimization.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies:

üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì The primary platform used for designing the interactive data model and developing the visualization reports.

üìÇ Power Query (M Language) ‚Äì Employed for data extraction, cleaning, and transforming the raw transactional data (e.g., standardizing currencies, date hierarchies, and handling missing SKU data).

üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Crucial for creating powerful analytical measures and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Profit Margin %, Average Order Value (AOV), and Year-over-Year Sales Growth.

üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì Structured relationships between tables (e.g., Sales, Products, Customers, Geography) to ensure accurate cross-filtering across all dimensions.

üìÅ File Format ‚Äì Developed as a Power BI Report file (.pbix).

üíæ Data Source
The project relies on a transactional dataset reflective of e-commerce operations.

Source: Mock/Sanitized Amazon Sales Transactional Data (Hypothetical)

Data Content: The dataset contains records of product sales, typically including fields such as:

Sales Metrics: Order ID, Sales Amount, Unit Price, Quantity, Profit, Profit Margin.

Product Details: SKU, Category, Sub-Category, and Product Name.

Customer & Geography: Customer ID, Shipping Region, State, and City.

Time Series Data: Order Date, Ship Date, and Month/Year hierarchy.

‚ú® Features / Highlights
The primary goal of this dashboard is to deliver clear, actionable business intelligence for a competitive e-commerce environment.

Business Problem Managing an e-commerce platform generates massive amounts of transactional data, making it difficult to find critical, real-time insights buried in tables. Decisions regarding stock levels, marketing spend, and pricing are often reactive rather than proactive.

Goal of the Dashboard To provide an interactive tool that centralizes, measures, and visualizes sales performance, allowing users to:

Monitor business health via key financial and operational metrics.

Identify the highest and lowest performing products and regions.

Analyze historical trends to forecast demand and plan promotions.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Hypothetical)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Highlighting total Sales, Profit, AOV, and Order Count for the selected period.

Sales by Category/Sub-Category (Treemap/Bar Chart): Visualizing the revenue contribution of different product groups to identify bestsellers and inventory focuses.

Historical Sales Trend (Time Series Chart): A line chart tracking monthly sales and profit to highlight seasonality and growth over time.

Geographical Sales Map: A heat map showing sales performance filtered by Region or State, pinpointing market penetration strengths and opportunities.

Customer Segmentation (Table/Bar Chart): Displaying sales metrics segmented by Customer Type (e.g., New vs. Returning) or shipping mode efficiency.

Business Impact & Insights

Inventory Optimization: Accurately identify slow-moving stock versus high-demand items, minimizing holding costs and avoiding stockouts.

Marketing Effectiveness: Measure the immediate impact of regional or category-specific promotions based on actual sales data.

Profitability Analysis: Pinpoint products or regions with high sales volume but low profit margins, informing corrective action or divestment decisions.
